# Disney-Movies-and-Box-Office-Success

Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, you will analyze data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. You will also perform hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.
